"""A nuisance that drifts across epochs, and the recursion that integrates it out.

A ``per_epoch`` latent is re-drawn every night and integrated away inside its own
epoch. A ``linked`` one is not: it is a Markov chain, and condition C1b says that
declaring one ``per_epoch`` marginalises a single physical fluctuation N times
against independent priors, injecting information that is not there. The exact
alternative is this module.

**The recursion.** Carry a joint square-root information factor over
``(theta, zeta_e)``. Fold in an epoch by stacking its rows and re-triangularising
-- :meth:`~rheplicant.inference.sqrtinfo.SqrtInfo.combine`'s arithmetic. Advance
to the next epoch by widening to ``(theta, zeta_e, zeta_{e+1})``, appending the
transition's rows, and marginalising ``zeta_e``: permute it first,
re-triangularise, drop row and column. That drop **is** the Schur complement, in
square root, which is what keeps a thousand-epoch accumulation inside float64
where the explicit ``(F, b)`` form goes indefinite. ``theta`` is never
marginalised, so what comes back is ``log p(d_1:N | theta)`` exactly.

**Two sub-scopes, because "linear-Gaussian" is not enough.** An OU with an
inferred correlation time is still linear-Gaussian, so a caveat phrased that way
is satisfied while its claim fails: ``Q(theta)``, ``phi(theta)`` and the Schur
complement all become functions of theta, and a filter run at compression time
pins them silently. The distinction lives in the *type*: a
:class:`LinearGaussianTransition` holds numbers and the theta posterior is exact
under filtering; a :class:`HyperTransition` holds a builder and is resolved
**inside** the theta likelihood, so the whole recursion is a differentiable
``lax.scan`` over the stored per-epoch blocks. One code path serves both, because
the recursion is traceable either way -- which is also why the fixed case is
validated by the same tests rather than by a second implementation of the same
arithmetic.

    Attributes:
        phi: ``(n, n)``. A full matrix, because a multi-component drift can
            rotate; the process and initial spreads are diagonal because a
            correlated *innovation* is a modelling claim nobody has made and a
            silently-accepted full covariance would need its own Cholesky
            refusal.
        process_std: ``(n,)``, strictly positive.
        initial_std: ``(n,)``, strictly positive -- ``sd(zeta_1)``.
        initial_mean: ``(n,)``. Zero unless declared.
        hyper: empty for a fixed transition. Present so that
            :class:`~rheplicant.inference.factorize.Factorization` can ask one
            question of either type.

    **Positivity is checked here and nowhere else, on purpose.** The rows this
    class contributes are what constrain every ``zeta_e``, so a strictly
    positive spread makes each marginalisation's block full-rank *by
    construction* -- and that is what lets the filter call
    :func:`~rheplicant.inference.sqrtinfo.marginalise_arrays` inside a
    ``lax.scan`` instead of the checked
    :func:`~rheplicant.inference.sqrtinfo.marginalise`, which concretises and
    therefore cannot be traced or differentiated. One eager check at
    declaration, not one traced check per epoch of a thousand.

    A traced spread is **not** checked, and cannot be: a
    :class:`HyperTransition` builds these blocks from theta, and under NUTS
    theta goes wherever it likes. Parameterise the builder so that positivity is
    structural -- return ``jnp.exp(log_sigma)``, never a raw sampled scale --
    which is why this class takes standard deviations rather than a covariance.
